## Project Overview
A simple fitness tracker using MongoDB and Atlas for performing CRUD operations through utilizing NOSQL database flexibility and syntax.

### Project Status:

*COMPLETED*

#### Issues to debug:
* issues exist within the given source code as front-end UI/UX shortfalls
    - both "Compelte" and "Add Exercise" buttons on exercise.html will submit form data
    - toast will indicate same message: "Workout sucessfully added" for both buttons
    - only lastest workout displayed

**Although not the intended purpose for this assignment, lack of font-end user-friendly functions caused some minor confusion.**
